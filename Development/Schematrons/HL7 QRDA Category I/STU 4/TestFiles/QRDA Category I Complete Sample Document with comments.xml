        The act of legal authentication requires a certain privilege be granted to the legal

        may be released before legal authentication.  
        All clinical documents have the potential for legal authentication, given the appropriate
        credentials.
        Local policies MAY choose to delegate the function of legal authentication to a device or
        system that generates the clinical document. In these cases, the legal authenticator is a
