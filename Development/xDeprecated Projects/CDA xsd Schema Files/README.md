This section contains the xsd schema validation files that define the syntactic structure of a Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) file. 

The xsd files are used by the ESAC Schematron Validator and Validate & Merge applications to validate data files syntactically prior to validating with a schematron.

The xsd files are used internally by these applications, so the files in the section are for reference only.

For more information about CDA and validation thereof, please see the HL7 Wiki at http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Software_Implementation_of_CDA
