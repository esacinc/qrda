/**
 * The Failure class represents a failure generated when a test XML file is validated against a given schematron.
 * 
 * A Failure is considered 'critical' if the failure is generated due to an "error" assertion failing: A SHALL assertion fails 
 * A Failure is considered non-critical if the failure is generated due to a "warning" assertion failing. A SHOULD/MAY assertion fails
 * 
 * The id, location, test and statement instance variables in a Failure object are copies of data elements in the test XML file that
 * was validated.
