        does not contain this element has not been legally authenticated.
        The act of legal authentication requires a certain privilege be granted to the legal

        Local policies MAY choose to delegate the function of legal authentication to a device or
        system that generates the clinical document. In these cases, the legal authenticator is a
        person accepting responsibility for the document, not the generating device or system.
