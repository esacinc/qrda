<h1>QRDA</h1>
The QRDA repository is for storing the schematron files, test data, and any testing tools for validating the changes
made to the schematron files as a part of the eCQM project. 

As of June 11, 2019 this repository contains a single directory: <b>Published Schematrons</b>.   

(Prior to June 11, 2019 an additional directory, <b>Development</b> contained work in progress for schematrons and other internal application development. All
such development files have been re-located to another ESAC repository with limited access.)

The <b>Published Schematrons</b> section of the repository contains the HL7 and CMS QRDA I and QRDA III schematron files (and related supporting files) that have been officially released to the HL7 GForge SVN.
