<h1>QRDA</h1>
The QRDA repository is for storing the schematron files, test data, and any testing tools for validating the changes
made to the schematron files as a part of the eCQM project. 

This repository contains two main areas:  <b>Development</b> and <b>Published Schematrons</b>.   

Everything under the <b>Development</b> section of the repository is considered work in progress. These files and projects
are not necessarily ready for release. 

The <b>Published Schematrons</b> section of the repository contains the HL7 and CMS QRDA I and QRDA III schematron files (and related supporting files) that have been officially released to the HL7 GForge SVN.
