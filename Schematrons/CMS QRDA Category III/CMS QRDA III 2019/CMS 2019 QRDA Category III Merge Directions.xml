    Changes made in the 2019 CMS Eligible Clinicians and EPs QRDA Schematron:
    
            Document-level template:
                - Added document-level check for presence of QRDA-Category-III-Report templateId and QRDA Category IIII Report - CMS templateId
                - Renamed “Advancing Care Information” to “Promoting Interoperability"  throughout
                - Updated QRDA Category III Report – CMS (V3) (identifier urn:hl7ii:2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.27.1.2:2018-05-01)
                    - Updated assignedEntity/documentationOf/representedOrganization to support MIPS virtual group reporting.
                        For MIPS virtual group reporting: it must contain exactly one performer, which contains on Virtual Group Identifier. No NPI is allowed.
                        This assignedEntity SHALL contain exactly one [1..1] representedOrganization (CONF:3338-18180).
                        This representedOrganization SHOULD contain zero or one [0..1] id (CONF:3338-18181_C01) such that it
                             SHALL contain exactly one [1..1] @root="2.16.840.1.113883.4.2" Tax ID Number (CONF:3338-18182).
                                   Note: This OID contained in the @root (2.16.840.1.113883.4.2) designates that the @extension must hold a Tax Identification Number (TIN).
                             SHALL contain exactly one [1..1] @extension (CONF:3338-18190).
                                   Note: This is the organization's TIN. 
                        This representedOrganization SHOULD contain zero or one [0..1] id (CONF:CMS_79) such that it
                             SHALL contain exactly one [1..1] @root="2.16.840.1.113883.3.249.5.2" MIPS Virtual Group (CONF:CMS_80).
                                   Note: This OID contained in the @root (2.16.840.1.113883.3.249.5.2) designates that the @extension must hold a Virtual Group Identifier.
                             SHALL contain exactly one [1..1] @extension (CONF:CMS_81).
                                   Note: This is the Virtual Group Identifier.
                    - Updated component to support that the performance period for both Quality and Improvement Activities performance categories for MIPS reporting must be specified at the individual measure/activity level. 
                        This structuredBody MAY contain zero or one [0..1] component (CONF:3338-17283) such that it
                             SHALL contain exactly one [1..1] QRDA Category III Measure Section - CMS (V3) (identifier: urn:hl7ii:2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.27.2.3:2018-05-01) (CONF:3338-17301_C01).
                        This structuredBody MAY contain zero or one [0..1] component (CONF:3338-21173) such that it
                             SHALL contain exactly one [1..1] Improvement Activity Section  - CMS (identifier: urn:hl7ii:2.16.840.1.113883.3.249.20.2.1:2018-05-01) (CONF:3338-21174_C01).
                    - Updated CMS_14 conformance assertion: If ClinicalDocument/informationRecipient/intendedRecipient/id/@extension="CPCPLUS", then Performance Rate for Proportion Measure – CMS (V3) SHALL be present (CONF:CMS_14)
                             Changed assert to allow for more than one Performance Rate for Proportion Measure – CMS (V3)
            
            Section-level templates:
               - Removed constraints that prohibited performance period for the Improvement Activity Section performance at tbe category level (CMS_77, CMS_78, CMS_84).
               - Removed constraints that prohibited performance period for the QRDA Category III Measure Section performance category for MIPS reporting must be specified at the individual measure level (CMS_68, CMS_69, CMS_85). 
               - Added Improvement Activity Section – CMS (identifier urn:hl7ii: 2.16.840.1.113883.3.249.20.2.1:2018-05-01) as a new template.

               - Added Improvement Activity Performed Measure Reference and Results CMS template
               - Removed constraint that the performance period for the Improvement Activity performance category should be specified at the individual activity level.
               - Removed constraint in Improvement Activity requiring exactly one [1..1] Reporting Parameters Act (identifier: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.17.3.8) (CONF:CMS_75)
               - Updated the Measure Data – CMS (V3) (identifier urn:hl7ii:2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.27.3.16:2018-05-01) to contain the following templates directly.

               - Updated Meausre Reference and Results – CMS (V3) (identifier urn:hl7ii:2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.27.3.17:2018-05-01) to remove conflict with HL7 conformance: 3259-1845_CO1
               - Updated Payer Supplemental Data Element CMS (V3) (identifier urn:hl7ii:2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.27.3.18:2018-05-01) to contain only CMS related conformance assertions
               - Updated Performance Rate for Proportion Measure – CMS (V3) (identifier urn:hl7ii:2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.27.3.25:2018-05-01) to contain only CMS related conformance assertions
